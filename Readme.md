# Speakup Api Clients

Simple starters to communicate with the Speakup ecosystem. The main goal of this project is to get
started fast, and give an example on how to authenticate.

## Python Example
To get started, contact [Speakup](https://speakup.nl/contact/) support for an api key and a secret.
Edit python/invoices.py with your api key. After this you can retrieve invoices with

``python3 python/invoices.py``
